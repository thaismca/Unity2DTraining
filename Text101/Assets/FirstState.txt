Bridge(D/E): Brian has everything packed and is ready to leave the house. Ana still try once more to convince Brain to have a seat and listen, but he has made his mind. He says he was raised by one of the best FBI Agents of the United States, and that he could never tolerate people involved with any kind of criminal activity. Henry is devastated. He knows that he would never be involved in this whole mess if it wasn't for his deceased business partner.

She thinks they should alert the cartel about this mess, so they can help Henry to deal with the situation. Henry is worried that the only solution for the cartel is to kill Brian, and there's a chance that they might decide to kill their family too, so that kind of issue would never happen again. But he also knows that if the cartel gets to know about Brian from someone else, they will kill Henry and his family anyways.
